## Executive summary
The aim of this study was to determine the variables that cause people’s unwillingness to pay for music streaming media platforms. The results of this study aim to help some music streaming media companies to improve their subscription users who can pay for them. The following problem statement was formulated:
"why people don’t want to pay for music streaming media platforms?"

Based on literature review and exploratory study, a conceptual model of people’s unwillingness to pay for music streaming media platforms was constructed. The conceptual model includes expensive streaming subscription fees, appearance of a lot of free channels to listen to music with good quality, most of people choose free channels to listen to music and people don’t want to pay for streaming media. To examine the effect of the independent variables on people’s unwillingness to pay for music streaming media platforms, the online survey was used. The results of this survey showed that previous variables: expensive streaming subscription fees, appearance of a lot of free channels to listen to music with good quality, most of people choose free channels to listen to music all indeed have influence on people’s unwillingness to pay for music streaming media platforms. Furthermore, the result also showed that in addition to these variables, there are several new variables: occupation, income situation, other ways to listen to music, such as CDs, cassettes, social media platforms or concerts, people’s dislike for music, which develop other relationships: 
1) For people who don’t work related to music, they have low frequency to listen to music, leads to they don’t want to pay for music streaming medias. 
2) For people who don’t like or are not interested in music, they don’t listen to music at all, so it is impossible to spend money on music. 
3) When subscription fees are expensive, and free channel with high quality come into the market, those people who accept low to medium income from companies or their family will choose these free platforms immediately, and don’t consider other paid streaming media platforms. 
4)  If there are many ways of listening to music in current market, people may not choose streaming media platforms based on their preference, so it is not necessary to pay for them.

Based on the results of this study, it is recommended that current music streaming media companies should take some measures to increase people’s interest in them, and attract more users to focus on music streaming media platforms rather than other ways to listen to music. 
For example, these companies may provide a large number of music libraries and sponsor some music TV shows.
